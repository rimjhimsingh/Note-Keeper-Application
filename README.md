# Notes Keeper

## Introduction
Notes Keeper is a dynamic web application built using React, enabling users to effortlessly create, view, and delete notes. This project was developed to solidify my knowledge and skills while learning about React and web development.

## Technologies
- **React**: Utilized for building the user interface with functional components and hooks to manage state and lifecycle features.
- **Material-UI**: Provides icons and components like `Fab` and `Zoom` to enhance the visual aspects and interactivity of the application.
- **CSS**: Used for styling components to ensure the application is visually appealing.

## Features
- **Create Notes**: Users can add notes with a title and content.
- **View Notes**: All added notes are displayed on the main interface, where each note appears with its respective title and content.
- **Delete Notes**: Each note can be deleted using the delete icon associated with that note.
- **Responsive Design**: The application adjusts the layout and elements for different screen sizes and orientations.

## Code Practices
- **Component-Based Architecture**: The application is structured into multiple reusable React components such as `Header`, `Footer`, `Note`, and `CreateArea`.
- **State Management**: Uses React's `useState` hook for local state management to track and update the user's input and the notes array.
- **Event Handling**: Implements functions to handle events like clicks and form submissions, enabling interactive capabilities.
- **Conditional Rendering**: Uses logical operators to conditionally render components and enhance the user interface, such as expanding the text input field when it is clicked.
